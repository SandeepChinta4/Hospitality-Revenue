## Problem Statement

Atliq Grands, a longstanding player in the hospitality industry with multiple five-star hotels across India, is experiencing a decline in market share and revenue within the luxury/business hotels category. This decline is attributed to competitive pressures and ineffective management decisions. To regain their market position, the managing director has proposed integrating "Business and Data Intelligence" into their operations. However, lacking an in-house data analytics team, they have opted to engage a third-party service provider to derive insights from their historical data.

### Task List

As a data analyst tasked with this project, you are provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard. Your objectives include:

- Creating metrics as outlined in the metric list.
- Developing a dashboard based on stakeholder-provided mock-ups.
- Generating additional insights beyond the provided metric list and mock-up.
